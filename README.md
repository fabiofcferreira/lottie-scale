#Lottie Scale

Lottie Scale is a very small NPM package to allow those with very little and out-of-scale SVG animations exported from Bodymovin to scale them, just by providing the container element and the scale multiplier.

It's particularly simple, that is, a single function call.

##How to use

There are two possible ways to use Lottie Scale.

### Head `<script>` tag

### Module import (ES6 import)
